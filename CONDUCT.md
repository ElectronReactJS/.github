# Organization-Wide Code of Conduct

## Introduction

This Code of Conduct provides guidelines for all members and contributors within the ElectronReactJS organization. Our goal is to maintain a cohesive, respectful, and collaborative environment across all our projects, particularly those combining Electron and React technologies.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Commit Messages

Clear and structured commit messages are essential for a transparent Git history. Refer to the organization-level [COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md](COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md) for our commit message conventions.

### Configuration Standards

Consistency in configuration files like `.env`, `.gitconfig`, and `.editorconfig` ensures a seamless development environment. Detailed standards are available in [CONFIGURATION_GUIDELINES.md](CONFIGURATION_GUIDELINES.md).

### Dependency Management

Our projects aim to be OS-agnostic. Guidelines for managing dependencies without compromising this principle can be found in [DEPENDENCY_GUIDELINES.md](DEPENDENCY_GUIDELINES.md).

### Error Handling

A structured approach to error handling is critical for a developer-friendly environment. Our practices are documented in [ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDELINES.md](ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDELINES.md).

### Naming Conventions

To maintain code readability and maintainability, we follow specific variable naming conventions detailed in [NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md](NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md).

## Adherence

Contributors are expected to adhere to these guidelines to ensure the ElectronReactJS organization's repositories remain high-quality, efficient, and accessible.
